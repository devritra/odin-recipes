    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Pasta was originally only made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Two eggs</li>
        <li>A splash of olive oil</li>
        <li>And a bit of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with a very large pot of water, about 6 quarts per pound of pasta. Bring it to a rapid boil.</li>
        <li>Put in a lot of salt, about 3 tablespoons. If you taste the water, it should taste like the sea.</li>
        <li>Drop in the pasta while the water is at a boil and give it a gentle stir.</li>
        <li>Stir it occasionally while it cooks. Use the cooking time on the pasta package as a guide.</li>
        <li>But watch out — it's hot! Sample the pasta at about 2 minutes shy of the indicated time. It should be al dente. You'll finish cooking it in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta. Just be sure to save about 1 cup of the pasta water. If you have a pot with a colander insert, use it to drain the pasta. If not, drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>If you're cooking ravioli, use a slotted skimmer and gently lift the ravioli a few at a time.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to your sauce and finish cooking it in the sauce. Give it a stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Ladle a few tablespoons of the pasta water at a time until you have the right consistency to your sauce. Remember, the pasta will absorb the liquid. Tip: Pasta water helps to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Simmer over medium-low heat — it'll help the pasta soak up the sauce. Follow your recipe's instructions for finishing the dish. And that's all there is to it. Perfecto!</li>
