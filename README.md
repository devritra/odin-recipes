This is a recipe website containing three recipes

This is my first project in "The Odin Project". It made clear the concept of commits, i wasn't commiting at first because i didn't have the right idea.

The Biriyani recipe may not be accurate cause i didn't pay attention if it makes sense or not. So just enjoy the looks of the website and i'd suggest not to try making the Biriyani how the site says.
